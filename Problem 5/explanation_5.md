To get suffixes i am using recurssion of nested children nodes and then appending it to final list

Time Complexity - O(N) As it will parse complete list to get suffixes
Space Complexity - O(N) Temporary list used to store suffixes 

Worst Case - When all words are same but last characters are different e.g. ["problem","problems","problemss"]
