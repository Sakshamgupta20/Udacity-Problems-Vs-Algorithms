We are using binary search 
For this with each iteration we are dividing the number in half and checking for solution

Time Complexity- 
    O(logn) -> It will be same as binary search

Space Complexity-
    I am using recursion to solve the problem and in between i am using a temporary variables like mid,ans,start,end
    So space complexity will be O(m) + O(a) + O(s) + O(e) => O(4)
